<h2>Mobile Library</h2>
<img src="thumbs/mobile.jpg" height="130" width="150" alt="Mobile library" />
<p class="intro" align="justify">Bookworms’ has been at the receiving end of many complaints from parents that children are wasting time in watching TV soaps, and playing addictive Computer games. They figured out that a possible reason is that there is no good library in their neighourhood where focus could be diverted to reading. After breaking our heads over this issue, we struck upon an ingenious plan… We chose to transform a mini truck into an inspirational wagon, decorated with lights and fans inside, with sufficient stacking of reading materials for different age group, and drive over to various areas periodically thereby motivating them and encouraging the kids to read books. So next time you open your window and smell the fresh air coming in, there you can see, the mobile edition of bookworms’ library trundling down to your doorstep <a href=mobilelib.html> Click to read

<h1>Cultivating and Motivating Reading Habit</h1>
<img src="images/reading.jpg" height="130" width="100" alt="Reading" />
<p align="justify">Reading is one of the best habits which starts from the age of a toddler and it continues throughout the life. Thus a good reading habit that is cultivated in the early stages of a child is like gifting the child with a fortune . There is nothing bigger than the “Wealth of Knowledge” – being earned and accumulated right from the childhood and through the older ages . It’s this habit that helps them to walk through the better spheres of education, career and the other prospects .

Child psychologists have very often stressed upon the importance of reading .

How and from where does the habit start? Of course, it is from parents. 

Children dog the footsteps of elders . Parents are their best role models. So, what the parents do would have a huge impact on their kids. The more they read , the more the child would gain .

The parents should make it a point that they have a reasonable time spent with their kids with good books around. They should initially read it aloud for them preferably with gestures and actions. They can narrate a story or a rhyme at the bed-time. The Child would pick up the sounds of the words and the meanings conveyed to them by the parents and slowly they would like to start self-reading. The parents can take the children to the nearest library and make them know what different types of books are available .

And for the grown ups, its better to read books than spending time on watching soaps and complaining of boredom.

What’re the gains on reading book?

You get every thing under the sky - It helps improving your vocabulary, knowledge, knowing more about places or countries that you can not visit, knowing more people whom you can not meet.

<h2>Quotations</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reading is an adventure that never ends!</li>

	<li>Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body!</li>
	<li>A good book on your shelf is a friend that turns its back on you and remains a friend!</li>

	<li>The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them!</li>
