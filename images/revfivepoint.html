<p style="line-height: 180%" align='justify'>
&nbsp&nbsp<b><font size=3>C</font></b>hetan Bhagat wrote this book from the view of a boy named Hari. He is the topper of his school and all India rank 453 in the IIT entrance exam. The story revolves around the friendship of 3 guys namely Alok Gupta, Ryan Oberoi, and Hari. It wouldnt be fair if I dint mention about these 3.

Hari is a fat fellow, often confused, never clear about his goal, ambition,aim etc. Alok is an aspiring student of the IIT who is from a poor family. His family depends on his future. Ryan is the Mr.Cool for Hari and Alok. He is a person who keeps blaming the IIT system and wants to enjoy life. All the three meet during ragging, by the seniors. Ryan saves the other two from deep trouble in ragging. Hence, they become the thickest of friends. Life moves on. The semester results declare all the 3 as Five Pointers( a system in IIT which ranks students as High,Average and Poor, 10 for High, 6+ for average,anything below 6- Poor)

Alok, gets terribly upset with his grades, hence, even with his friends. He splits up with Ryan & Hari. However, Alok finds it tough without them. Ryan, impresses Alok with his helping qualities, by helping Alok's father ( a cripple) to get medication etc.

Hari, becomes a friend of Neha( the daughter of an IIT professor). They fall in love etc etc.
To impress Neha's father, Hari aspires for an A in his major exams. Ryan, gives an idea to steal the paper,so that an A would be easy. However, all the 3 fail in the task of looting the paper. Get caught & therefore, suspended for 1 semester. Out of remorse, Alok attempts suicide from the top of the building. From, here, I cant tell you the story as it is to be digested and not fed.

The book promises a lot. One can read it through without yawning. Being, a resemblence of Dil Chahta Hai, the book is a must-read for humour lovers.
